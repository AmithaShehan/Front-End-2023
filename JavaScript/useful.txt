bracket notation in objects is useful when we have properties such as delivery-date. because in normal way it will consider - as minus sign
 console.log(product['delivery-date']);
we will get undifined as it is not defined in objects declaration. will not throw an error

a snippet using brackets
  const product = {
   name:'shirt',
   ['delivery-time']: '5 days'
  };
  console.log(product);
  console.log(product.name);
  console.log(product['name']);
  console.log(product['delivery-time']);
